# Group project is to design a simple 2D grid-based game using the Java programming language and JavaFX.
### Assignments to complete: 
1) At least one abstract class and one interface: It is not enough that your game “works” – you must show that you understand the tenets of object-oriented design!  The size of these items is not important; it is the design that is of utmost importance, because you also must demonstrate…
2) Polymorphism: Have your code be as flexible as possible.  For example, can your game easily incorporate a smarter computer player without having to rewrite large blocks of code?
3) Design Approach Explanation: This should be a 2-3 page document explaining your design process.  Which process did your group choose (waterfall model, iterative model, V-shaped, etc.) and how did it evolve as your project formed?
4) UML Diagram: All of your classes, as well as their relationships, need to be shown in a UML diagram.
